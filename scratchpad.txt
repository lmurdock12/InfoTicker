Issue: Fixing the flicker (#1)

    Currently I am working out of a couple of different demo files...One main file for the image only
    demo, one file for the text only demo, and one file called 'scroller' that was meant for image + 
    text. 

    I created the scroller file by just copying over the specific parts I needed from the example files,
    and I was getting some really weird flickering stuff when trying to scroll the images in the texts.

    To fix back and tried to use the text demo and insert my new super class there and see if image
    and text would work together. After messing around with some coloring issues I found that I Could
    render the images fine if "canvas->SetPWMBits(1)" was commented out.
        - Need to look more into why this was the case but this fixed all the coloring issues.

    I do not think the best approach is to strip out all the command line arguments and stuff
    so I am basically going to leave everything is in "demo.cpp". I will strip anything none 
    essentially..bring that into scroller, and go from there. That should take care of the flicker
    issue for now.

    Doing images and text at the same time now works.


    Starting to understand a little but more about how Canvas, RGBMatrix, and FrameCanvas work.
    These essentially are all being used pretty interchangebly, and one good capability with this 
    library is that you can fill one of the canvas before the next render and then quickly switch 
    out canvas so it displays faster. I think you can basically use as many canvas as you want,
    but at the end of the day they are all rendering to the same screen



    Issue:

    Need to be rendering to the same canvas or something....currently the text part of the image
    gets rendered and then immediately whipped with the next render of the image
